	volume = {6},
	abstract = {This paper explores the history of Christmas as a demarcated time of festival. First, it traces the early history of Christmas, and the early Church’s attitude towards pagan mid-winter festivals. It then outlines how the Puritans of early modern England eventually outlawed Christmas, and on what grounds. It then considers in detail Josiah King’s The Examination and Tryal of Father Christmas, a seventeenth-century allegory about the festival published and revised over several decades. It tracks editorial changes made over the years and its various appeals to medieval and ancient forms of authority. The text itself is but one site of a larger cultural contestation over the power to prescribe meaning to contemporaries’ lived experiences.},

	title = {Newspapers as historical sources},
	abstract = {A world without news is almost unimaginable. As inquisitive and social animals, we want to know about the world around us and of the latest news of import. Before the advent of the newspaper, news was spread widely and over long distances through letters and word-of-mouth. The advent of mass printing allowed people to reproduce set texts at a cheap price, creating a national news media that meant a farmer in the rural countryside could read the same news and opinion as a banker in the heart of the city.  
Newspapers are valuable sources for historical research. A product of the printing age, newspapers were published to communicate information and the news to a wide audience. They contain a vast array of material that is useful to historians of every stripe. Although they may profess their impartiality, like any other source newspapers have certain limitations that a researcher needs to keep in mind. This case study will explore how you can use newspapers fruitfully. By looking at two newspapers – the Asiatic Mirror and Harrop’s Manchester Mercury – in detail, we will discuss the best ways of approaching these sources, and how we can best utilise them for historical research.},

	title = {Correspondence and manuscripts in literary archives},
	abstract = {Literary archives contain the documents and artefacts that relate to the creation and publication of literary texts. Defined more narrowly here in terms of writing as an art composition, literature includes the classic forms  of poetry, prose, and drama, to newer forms like the graphic novel. These texts form the cultural touchstones of human civilisation, from the ancient and medieval epics to William Shakespeare’s plays, to Jane Austen’s novels and Jonathan Swift’s satires, to Isaac Asimov’s science fiction and modern American comics. Usually based around a creator or an institution, literary archives pull together material that help us understand literary texts better. 
These collections illuminate important aspects of literary creation. Notes and draft manuscripts offer valuable insight into how a work was composed and reworked over time. They speak to important questions of authorship and the involvement of the editor and the publisher. Private papers like correspondence and diaries can shed light into an author’s state of mind and motivations, as well as the social circles and cultural milieu in which they participated Publishers’ records contain valuable information about the sales and geographical distribution of literary products,  while material objects can provide insight into  the physical environment in which literature was created.
This case study focuses on two types of sources most used by historians:   personal correspondence and draft manuscripts. You will learn how to approach these sources, how they are useful to historians, and what limitations they have.},

	volume = {Forthcoming},
	abstract = {The unprecedented trial and execution of Charles I left a nation aghast and bewildered. This article examines how the English reacted to such a disruptive event, namely in how the regicide changed ideas of time and the future. Using a diachronic approach, this article examines the work of three history writers and the temporalities embedded within their narratives. Recognising the significance of the regicide as a singular moment in time, these writers adapted their work to incorporate a sense of changed times. By envisioning futures in their texts, these histories informed but also circumscribed the worldviews of their readers.},
