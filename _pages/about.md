I am a historian of early modern mental worlds, with interests in understanding senses of time and place, and the repercussions of trauma and disruption. My doctoral research at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/), conducted under the supervision of [Dr David Smith](https://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/people/david-l-smith) examined the execution of King Charles I as a moment of ideational change and adaptation. Taking a diachronic approach to periodicals like almanacs and newsbooks, I traced how ideas of time and the future evolved in response to unexpected political change.

As a Postdoctoral Research Assistant with the ['Brightening the Covenant Chain' AHRC project](https://treatiedspaces.com/brightening-the-covenant-chain), I will be visualising concepts of space and movement in the form of a ‘kinetic map’. This digital platform, created in collaboration with [King’s Digital Lab](https://kdl.kcl.ac.uk/), is an exciting opportunity to communicate historical research and sources in a new visual manner. The project may illustrate previously unseen connections in the documentary record, and it also has the potential to reach a wide audience and communities traditionally excluded from the conversation.

I completed my MSc at the [S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies](https://www.rsis.edu.sg/), a graduate school of [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), where I focused on aspects of discourse analysis and the role of imagined spaces in the domain of international law and diplomacy. My first degree was in History, jointly awarded by the [National University of Singapore](http://nus.edu.sg/) and the [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/), where I first started working on early modern England.

I am an Associate Fellow of the [Higher Education Academy](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/) (AFHEA) and an Early Career Researcher member of the [Royal Historical Society](https://royalhistsoc.org/).
