I am a historian of early modern England, having completed my PhD at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/) under the supervision of [Dr David Smith](https://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/people/david-l-smith). My doctoral project focused on the regicide of Charles I as a traumatic and disruptive event, and its impact on conceptions of time and the future. I examined the temporal narratives of contemporaries publishing during and after the English Civil War, including astrologers, historians, and newsbooks editors and writers of the later Stuart and Commonwealth periods.

I completed my MSc at the [S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies](https://www.rsis.edu.sg/), a graduate school of [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), where I focused on aspects of discourse analysis and the role of imagined spaces in the domain of international law and diplomacy. I graduated with my joint degree in History from the [National University of Singapore](http://nus.edu.sg/) and the [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/), where I first started working on early modern England.

I am an Associate Fellow of the [Higher Education Academy](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/) (AFHEA) and an Early Career Researcher member of the [Royal Historical Society](https://royalhistsoc.org/).
