I am a historian of early modern England, having completed my PhD at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of Dr David Smith. My doctoral project focused on the regicide of Charles I as a traumatic and disruptive event, and its impact on conceptions of time and the future. I examined the temporal narratives of contemporaries publishing during and after the English Civil War, including astrologers, historians, and newsbooks editors and writers of the later Stuart and Commonwealth periods.

I completed my MSc at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, a graduate school of Nanyang Technological University, where I focused on aspects of discourse analysis and the role of imagined spaces in the domain of international law and diplomacy. I graduated with my joint degree in History from the National University of Singapore and the Australian National University, where I first started working on early modern England.

In September 2018, I was accredited as an Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (AFHEA). The HEA benchmarks excellence in higher education teaching against the UK Professional Standards Framework (UKSPF).
